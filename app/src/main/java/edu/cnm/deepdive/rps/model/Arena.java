/**
 * Models a non-transitive competitive ecosystem. With 3 breeds, the resulting ecosystem resembles
 * an evolutionary game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. While it can be a practical challenge to enumerate
 * the relationship of a non-transitive system with many more breeds than 3, it is in fact very
 * straightforward to simulate such a system&mdash;at least in an idealized form: dominance
 * relationships between the breeds can be envisioned by arranging them in regular intervals around
 * a circle; any given breed dominates those breeds that can be reached via a shorter path in the
 * counter-clockwise direction than in the clockwise direction.
 * <p>This ecosystem model is a stochastic CA, where all cells survive unchanged to the next
 * generation&mdash;with the possible exception of the cell chosen at random to be the "challenger",
 * and that cell's randomly selected neighbor (the "defender"). One or both (in the event of a tie)
 * of these 2 cells survive to the next generation, while the loser (if there is not a tie) is
 * replaced by a copy of the winner.</p>
 * <p>The size of the terrain where the ecosystem resides is square, and the topology is toroidal:
 * cells on the left and right edges of any given row are considered to be neighbors, as are cells
 * at the top and bottom of any given column.</p>
